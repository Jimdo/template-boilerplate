// Add your variables and import the base to get the style.css out of everything.

// Personal preference here: Provide a black and a white tone to use in your template.
// Doesn't have to be completely white and black, of course.
// Awesome advice on the black here: http://ianstormtaylor.com/design-tip-never-use-black/

// Of course, the variables used here most certainly won't be your final variables,
// so feel free to adjust/delete everything, add stuff etc.

$white: #fff
$black: #000

@import "base"
